# Blackjack App

## Introduction
Welcome to my Blackjack app! This program simulates a replayable game of blackjack utilizing OOP and Java Swing.

## Features
- Ability to stand, or hit
- Wager in-game currency
- Five-Card Charlie Rule
- Dealer must stand on 17 or higher

## Why I Chose to Make This
I chose to build this project because of my interest in game design, and I hope this is the first of many gaming-related projects.

## How to Run
Simply run the main method, located in Main.java file in the src/ui folder.

## Possible Future Goals
- If I had the chance I would definitely want to implement a local multiplayer, similar to a couch co-op.
