# Blackjack App

## Introduction
Welcome to my Blackjack app! This program simulates a replayable game of blackjack utilizing OOP and Java Swing. Originally designed with singleplayer features, I later transformed the game to support multiplayer functionality with sequential, turn-based actions.

## Features
- Ability to stand, or hit
- Wager in-game currency
- Five-Card Charlie Rule
- Dealer must stand on 17 or higher
- Seamless Replayability

## Multiplayer Functionality
- 1-5 Player Support
- Turn-Based Gameplay
- Individual Balance Tracking
- Consolidated End-Game Results Summary

## Why I Chose to Make This
I chose to build this project because of my interest in game design, and I hope this is the first of many gaming-related projects.

## How to Run
Simply run the main method, located in Main.java file in the src/ui folder. This will access the welcome screen, where you can choose to either play singleplayer or multiplayer.
